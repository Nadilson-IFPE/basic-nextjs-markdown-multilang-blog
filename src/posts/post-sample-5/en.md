Here, you add the content of the post and can insert links and other visuals like videos if you want, local or remote source. You just need to know how it works and how to create the structure of a **[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)** file (click on the term to learn more in the documentation of the open-source reference guide or click **[here](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/)** to use an application that facilitates the work in creating the files). Here's an example video embedded in the post:

Local video:

 <video controls class="relative z-10 w-auto min-w-full min-h-full max-w-none aspect-auto">
    <source src="YOUR_VIDEO_PATH_HERE" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the display of videos.
</video>

Video on YouTube or other services:

Here, you can continue the text of the post and even add other visual resources, in HTML or not, as in this example:

This **word** is in bold. This other <em>**word**</em> is bold and italicized.
