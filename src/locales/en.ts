At the moment, in addition to looking for a new job, I've been investing my free time to "play" with various technologies and frameworks, while still reading my books and articles related to the two areas I belong to. I'm also into playing the electric guitar. So much so that I have three, each one with a different tuning to play Extreme Metal (Drop C, Drop D and Drop C#), an excuse I used to spend money on this type of musical instrument.`,
